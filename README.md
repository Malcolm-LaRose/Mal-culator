Educational project to learn basic C++

Began as a factorio recipe calculator, which is essentially functional
Now I desire to be able to input recipes automatically and not by hand
Work has focused on recipeParser.cpp
Next goal is to take the data from recipeParser.cpp and input it as the recipe initializations in FactorioCalculator++.cpp

Bonus points for using classes (to be claimed)
